## Previous knowledge

These are the minimum concepts you need from unit 0 in order to follow this lesson. 

- You should know how a computer works and what makes a computer, a computer (input, storage, processing, output)
- You should understand the concept of bit and how we use binary to manipulate data
- You should know different examples of operating systems
- You should know that we can find different types of software in a computer

## Description

This first unit talks about the basic concepts of computing systems, and we will introduce the concept of operating systems.We will study why we need operating systems, what does an operating system provides, how does an operating system work, and which are the main functions of an operating system. 

Once these concepts are clear, we will learn more about how an operating system works: we will talk about the concepts of process and thread and we will take a brief look at the processor management and memory management.

## Contents

- Computing system concept
- Definition of an operating system
- Functions of an operating system
- OS elements
- OS design principles
- Types of operating systems: monolithic, modular, microkernel
- Processes:
    - Address space
    - Execution state
    - PCB
- Context switch
- Process vs Thread

### How to study / To do

To study this lesson, we will use an online free course from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/https://www.udacity.com/). The name of the course is [Introduction to Operating Systems.](https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud923) It has 4 parts with several lessons each one. The contents of the course exceed the needs of this unit, and we won’t be seeing it all, but it’s a really interesting course to keep as reference. 

<aside>
➡️ For each lesson on the Udacity course from the following list, you have to watch the video, take notes of the main concepts and study the concepts.

The subtitles transcriptions will help you to study.

Lessons to study:

- P1L1: Course Overview

In this lesson there are things that obviously don’t apply, such as course policies, but you should watch the introduction and the visual metaphor used. 

Week 1

- P1L2: Introduction to Operating Systems

All of it. 

Week 1

- P2L1: Processes and process management

Points 1 to 14

It’s important to understand the process concept. You also need to know what’s the difference between the virtual address space of a process and its actual mapping on the physical memory. Even if you don’t fully understand how this mapping is done or managed.

You also need to understand the concept of PCB and why it is important to manage context switches. But you don’t need to know every camp of the block or learn the exact steps to make a context switch.

It’s necessary to learn and understand the process state cycle.

Week 2

- P2L2: Threads

Points 1 to 6

Sometimes multithreading is confused with other terms, such as multiprogramming, and these videos clarify the term and explain the benefits of it

Week 2

As you can see, I’ve divided the contents in two weeks, but it is totally up to you. I’ve considered that you will watch lesson 1- take notes-study. But you may prefer to view all the videos first and then review them to take notes. You can decide.
